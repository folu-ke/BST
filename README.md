# BST
Full Implementation of a Binary Search Tree 

# Description
1. The BST class is an implementation of a binary search tree. This implementation provides guaranteed O(H) (H is the height of this tree which could be as low as logN for balanced trees, but could be as large as N for unbalanced trees) time cost for the basic operations (add, remove and contains). This class implements many of the methods provided by the Java framework's TreeSet class. Some parts and concepts of this code were understood and adapted from popular websites like GeeksForGeeks, StackOverflow and other websites.

2. The TestBST class is the main class used to test BST.java. It tests each unit (method) in the class to ensure a correct working class.

# Usage
The BST class can be used as a module to prosecute operations that are made easier using a binary search tree e.g.lookup tables, sorting etc. Please ensure to read every method comments in the Javadoc to be clear on the complexity of a method before use.
